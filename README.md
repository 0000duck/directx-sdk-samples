# DirectX SDK Samples

This repro contains samples that originally shipped in the legacy DirectX SDK. These are all **Windows desktop** applications for Windows Vista Service Pack 2 with the DirectX 11.0 runtime or later.

They have all been cleaned up to build using the Windows 8.x SDK that comes with Visual Studio 2012 or later, and DO NOT require the DirectX SDK to build.
